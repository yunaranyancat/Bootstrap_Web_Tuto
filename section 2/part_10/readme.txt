the padding and margins order work like a clock, from top, right, bot and left

example:

margin: 10px 12px 8px 6px;

but, you also can use only three values;

padding : 10px 5px 10px;, but it is rarely used.

if you add only two value;

padding : 10px 20px; = 10px padding will be applied to top and bottom, while 20px will be applied to right and left

if you add onlyone value, it will apply to all. (basic)

try

p{
  margin:0px;
  padding:0px;

  FOR FUN! XD

}

IMPORTANT: THE MARGIN COLLAPSE VERTICALLY

try:
margin 10px; -> the distance between paragraph would be 10px!
padding: 0px;
